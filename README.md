# Pac-Man

Developed a PacMan using JavaScript.  Created 4 PacMan images 2 facing right one with an open mouth one with a closed mouth.  Then 2 facing left one with an open mouth one with a closed mouth.  Set them on timeout functions so it appears as if the PacMan is moving back and forth across the screen like it does in the game.

In the future to develop the project out more I would like to add additional movments so that it can move up and down.  In addition, create a maze outlay for the Pacman to follow so it will act more like the game

Copy the code like it is displayed in a code editor and hit run.  You should see a Pacman run back and forth across the screen
