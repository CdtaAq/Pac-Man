# Pac-Man
Developed a PacMan using JavaScript.  Created 4 PacMan images 2 facing right one with an open mouth one with a closed mouth.  Then 2 facing left one with an open mouth one with a closed mouth.  Set them on timeout functions so it appears as if the PacMan is moving back and forth across the screen like it does in the game.
